## Notes

Ruby is the first module in the App Academy Full Stack Developer Curriculum. All of the material that you cover in these modules will seek to build upon previous days and as such, going back to review previous readings or videos will be in your best interest when time allows. Our Ruby module will have two assessments, one on W6D1 and one on W7D3, where you will be able to track your progress and understanding of the material as you learn it.

As with all future modules, any "Bonus" projects are to be completed after the standard projects for each day are completed. Sometimes that could mean going back to previous day's "Bonus" projects if you otherwise finish early. Additional Resources are readings, videos, or articles that are not required, but will serve to deepen your understanding of a topic. They will be denoted with a specific icon in your task menu.
