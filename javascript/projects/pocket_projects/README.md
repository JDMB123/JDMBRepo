## Introduction

**Live [Demo][demo]!**

Vanilla JavaScript is an incredibly important skill to have in both interviews and as a developer. Vanilla JS is also super fun and gives you amazing flexibility with what can be done on a webpage. So, today you and your partner will be getting comfortable with using vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery, etc.) to manipulate the DOM (document object model) and make things work on the page. Each of the phases of this project is a small 'pocket project' in that they can each stand on their own, but together you'll have a website with a lot of functionality!

### Webpack

Download the skeleton [here][skeleton].

You'll see two folders in the project directory, `/dist` and `/src`. The `/dist` folder will hold all of our 'distribution' code, including `index.html`, all our css files and our bundle, `main.js`. The `src` folder is where you will find all the files you will be working with today. Before you start changing things make sure to boot up webpack by running `webpack --watch --mode=development`.

## Phase 0: HTML Strings to DOM Elements

Start off by looking at the `index.html` - there you will see a `script` tag in your header linking to your bundle with the attribute `defer`. The HTML attribute `defer` means “wait for the parser to finish to execute this”. It’s roughly equivalent to binding your script to the DOMContentLoaded event. When your code does run, everything in the DOM will be available for you to use. 

As you start each phase you'll be importing each of your javascript files into `index.js`, and uncommenting the html for the phase you are working on. All of the JavaScript files you import into `src/index.js` will then also be read and bundled up by webpack into `dist/main.js`.

We'll warm up with something simple. Head to `src/warmup.js`. Once here you'll be see a function named `htmlGenerator`. The `htmlGenerator` function will take two arguments: a string, and a [`HTML Element`][html-dom]. The desired behavior of this function is the input string will be [converted into a `<p>` tag][create-element] and then [appended][append] to the input `HTML Element`. Never be afraid to look up the documentation for how to interact with `HTML Element`s if you need a reminder.

Since the [DOM][dom] is a traversable tree you can add to - use your `htmlGenerator` to add a fun phrase like "I <3 Vanilla DOM manipulation." to your `h1` tag. Now whenever you reload the page your `htmlGenerator` will append a `p` tag below your `h1` tag. Neat! Let's move on to the next phase.

## Phase 1: Clock

Now it's time to flex your Vanilla DOM muscles. We'll start by building a clock! Take a look at `index.html` and un-comment the html for `Phase 1: Clock` there you'll see a `div` with the id of "clock". This is the element you'll be building your clock upon. Before you start remember to import your clock file into `src/index.js` or your code won't be included by webpack.  

For this phase we'll be using the Clock class you previously wrote in the [functions exercises][clock]. A key idea in web development is making sure that every time the state changes, the UI also updates. You've previously done using jQuery for games like Tic Tac Toe and Hanoi. Let's now implement that concept the Clock class you previously wrote. 

So instead of the clock publishing the time via the console, use the string generated in the `.printTime` function to render your clock on the DOM using the `div` with the id of "clock". To accomplish this goal we'll use the `htmlGenerator` you just created! 

The first thing we'll need to do is make sure our clock is setup correctly. Outside of your Clock class create a variable named `clock` with a new instance of a `Clock`. Below that variable, create another variable named `clockElement` to get the DOM element with the id of "clock". Next we'll focus on altering our Clock class to make sure it renders the time on the DOM.

Import and use the `htmlGenerator` function inside the Clock class to take the string generated by `printTime()` and append it to the `clockElement`. You'll also want to make sure that whenever a new clock is constructed the `htmlGenerator` is also run to make sure that as soon as the page loads the clock is visible. Test it out!

At this point you probably realized your `htmlGenerator` generates html a little too well. In order to make sure only one `<p>` tag is ever appended to your Clock you'll have to add a little logic to the `htmlGenerator` function. You can do this by checking if the incoming htmlElement has any `children`, and it does, removing those children before appending any other elements. 

**Hint**: Remember that the `.children` will not return an array! For easier iteration you can use `Array.from` to convert the `HTMLCollection` into an array.  

Well, won't you look at the time? It's about time to head to the next phase!

## Phase 2: Drop Down Menu

You've probably implemented a dropdown using HTML and CSS before but let's build an fancier dropdown using JavaScript! Head to `src/drop_down.js` and you'll see a POJO with a list of dog names and links to information about each dog on the top on the file. Your final goal will be to dynamically convert the dog POJO into a dropdown with a list of dog names that you can click on for more information about that dog.  

Start off by creating a function called `dogLinkCreator`. This function will be responsible for iterating through the `dogs` POJO and returning an array of `li` tags that represent each dog. Start off by iterating through the POJO, for each dog you'll need to:

1. Create an `a` tag
1. Set the `a` tag's `innerHTML` to be the dog's name
1. Set the `a` tag's `href` to be the dog's information link
1. Create a `li` tag
1. Give the `li` tag the class of 'dog-link'
1. Append the `a` tag to the `li` tag
1. Push the completed `li` into an array of the dog links completed so far.

Now write a second function called `attachDogLinks`. In this function invoke the `dogLinkCreator` and assign the result to a variable named `dogLinks`. Now that you have your `dogLinks` array iterate through it and attach each `li` to the `ul` element with the class of `.drop-down-dog-list`. Then call your function at the bottom of your file and you will see your dogs appear!

Nice, your dogs are on the page! Time to add a dropdown effect. We need to make sure that the dogs won't appear unless the user's mouse has entered the "Here Are Some Dogs!" message. We can do this by utilizing `eventListeners`!

Here is where the `dog-link` class you added to all your `li` links will come in handy. By default use css to hide all of your `li`s when the page is loaded. Then write two functions `handleEnter` and `handleLeave` to make your dogs links appear and disappear. **Remember you can add and remove css classes using javascript!** 

Next you'll add your two new eventHandlers to an element on the page so that on [`mouseenter`][mouse-enter] the dog's links will appear and on [`mouseleave`][mouse-leave] the links will disappear. Think carefully on where you want to attach your two [event listeners][event-listener]. Keep in mind [event delegation][event-delegation] - you want to be able to hover on and click the dogs links without the dropdown disappearing.

## Phase 3: Todo List

By now you've read about how to use localStorage to store data in a client's browsers for later use. For the next phase we'll be creating a todo list that will use localStorage to persist todos through page refreshes. Let's get to it!

In `index.html` you'll see a form to add new todos. The expected behavior is that you will enter text into the input box, click the `+ Add Todo` button, and a new todo will populate the `todos` ul. You'll also want an indication if that todo is done or not, so you'll want to add a checkbox next to each todo. First thing we'll do is create an empty array and set it to the variable `todos` that will live outside the functions we'll be writing. This will be where all your `todos` will live. 

Next you'll want to set variables for two DOM elements, the `ul` with the class of `todos` and the form element with the class of `add-todo-form`. These will be the two elements we'll be adding our eventListeners to. Next we'll write our event listeners.

Create a function called `addTodo` that will be in charge of listening for the `submit` event on the form. The `addTodo` function will:

1. Find the input with the name `add-todo` and set's it's value to a variable
2. Create a new todo object with the value from `add-todo` and a `done` key set to false
3. Push the `todo` object into the `todos` array.
4. Reset the `add-todo` input to be empty so that the user can easily enter another `todo`

Now that we have the `todos` in an array we'll pass that array into another function we will create called `populateList`.  `populateList` will be in charge of taking each of the todos in the array and mapping them into `label` tag, with a checkbox next to each of them. Then you'll wrap the `label` tag and the checkbox `input` into an outer `li` tag. Once each todo is wrapped in an `li` append them all onto the `ul` with the class of `todos`. Make sure to call `populateList(todos)` inside your `addTodo` function to make sure that the list properly populates when the user submits their todo. Now setup your new `addTodo` `eventListener` to listen for the "submit" event on your form element.

Now that you've got your list showing up it's time to set it up in [localStorage][localStorage]. Our goal is that whenever a user refreshes the page all the todos we'd previously stored will be saved and then can be displayed to the user. In the `addTodo` function you'll want to use `localStorage.setItem` to store the entire `todos` array whenever a new todo is added. However, remember that localStorage can only store strings. You can use JSON's [`parse`][parse] and [`stringify`][stringify] to get your todos array in and out of localStorage intact. Now, you can setup your `todos` array so that it will be empty unless `localStorage.getItem` returns something. Now when you reload the page you can fetch the user's todos out of localStorage to then display them to the user. 

The final thing you'll need to tackle is making sure your todo items stay done! Write a new event listener that will trigger every time a checkbox is clicked. You'll probably need to know which checkbox is being clicked - and you can store that information on the checkbox element itself by utilizing the [data attribute][data]. Keep in mind [event delegation][event-delegation] -  make sure whatever is listening for the click will always be on the page.

[data]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes

## Phase 4: Slide In On Scroll

Time to explore an issue that can heavily impact performance. For this phase you'll be implementing a "scroll down and slide in" effect for a couple of pictures. In `index.html` you'll see some `img` tags that are currently invisible on the page. The desired end goal is to be able to scroll down the page and those images will **magically** slide in when you scroll to a certain point. 

In `src/slide_scroll.js` the first thing you'll want to do is set up an event listener on the `img` tags for the scroll event. Try `console.log`ing inside that function to see how many times the event happens as you scroll down the page. You'll probably notice you are logging about 10+ events before you even get to the bottom of the page. That might not seem like a lot, but imagine this page was hundreds of paragraphs long (like a law document or something) - the scroll event could trigger hundreds of times. That's a performance hit. That is also where **debouncing** comes in. To read more about this idea see [here][debounce], and view the demo from last night [here][debounce-demo]. You'll see that you've been provided a debouncing function, so utilize that function to make your event listener more efficient. 

Next it's time to make those images actually show up when you scroll down. If you look in `styles.css` and you'll see you've been provided with all the classes you need for this effect. 

You only want the image to slide in when the user has scrolled down to the exact middle on the picture.  You also want the image to disappear once the user has scrolled past the image (so if the user scrolls up from the bottom the image slides in again). Math time - you'll need to find out:

1. Where the image should slide in. 
2. Where the bottom of the image is.
3. Whether the picture is being half shown on the page currently.
4. If the image has been scrolled past.

**Hint:** Look at the properties on the window API and on the image tags to get the information you need. Don't be afraid to `console.log` values to make sure you understand the properties you are using!

Then add your 'css' classes and you are good to go!

## Bonus: Filtered Search

### Overview
For the next phase you'll be creating a Pokemon search that will filter based on what the user types in. Sounds neat right?

Head over to `src/search.js`. We'll be using the browser's built in [fetch API][fetch-api] to make a new HTTP request to fetch the data we'll be using in order to filter. So start off by using the provided `pokemonAPI` variable to fetch data, and then take the `response` you received and store it in an array. 

Now you have the data, let's write the next function which will `findMatches`. The `findMatches` function should receive a word it'll be looking to match, and the pokemon array to search through in order to find the match. In order to find a match you'll need to filter through the pokemon array using [Regular Expression][regex] and the [`match`][match] function to see if any of your accrued pokemon names match the word passed in.

From there the final step will be to display the found matches to the user. The next function you write `displayMatches` will not only display matches to the user, but will also be our `eventListener` for when a user enters information into the input with the class of `search`. 

The `displayMatches` function will be responsible for:

1. Calling the `findMatches` function with the fetched pokemon and the word to match, and then setting that to a variable `matchArray`
1. Iterate through the `matchArray` and create an `li` for each pokemon returned
1. Append the `li`s with the matching pokemon to the `ul` with the class of `suggestions`

Finally add an eventListener for `displayMatches` on to the "keyup" and "change" events on the `input` with a class of `search`. 

Great job! You are officially the cool kid with the pokemon search. 😎

## Bonus: Show Them The Weather!

So as the name of this phase suggest we will be showing the user the current weather for their location. To find a user's location you can use the handy dandy [geolocation API][geo]. For getting the current weather we'll be using the [open weather API][weather].

* Review the [open weather API][weather] documentation. We'll use this API to get the weather based on our current location (we recommend fetching the weather by geographic coordinates).

* In order to get the API to accept your HTTP requests, you'll need an API key.
[Read up on how to use the API key and sign up for one [here.][api-key] After signing up, click on the API keys tab to get your key. You may need to open their welcome email before the API key will work.

**NB:** In the real world, you should be very careful about placing
API keys in frontend JavaScript or anywhere else they are publicly
available and can be scraped (this includes public Git repos).
Stolen keys can cost you. **You have been warned.**

* Now let's get your current location! Write a function that will call `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` to get it. Read through the [documentation][geo]
to figure out how to use this function properly. (Make sure you have [location services
enabled][location-services] in your browser, or this won't work.)

* When the current location is received, use a callback to query the weather
API using a raw, "vanilla" JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest`.
  * See [here][vanilla-ajax] and [here][nojquery] for help with the XMLHttpRequest.
  * For more in-depth details, look at the [XMLHttpRequest Docs][xmlhttpdocs]
  * Hint: pass a callback to your location query that takes a `location` argument.  `console.log` that argument to figure out how to extract the information you need, then build your `XMLHttpRequest`.
  * Hint: You should build out the URI of your API request piece by piece, using the coordinates in the location argument and your API key.
  * Common pitfall: You need to include `http://` in your request URI
  * If you're spending more than 25 minutes setting up your request, ask a TA for help!
* Render the current city and temperature on the page.
  * **NB**: By default, the OpenWeatherMap API will return the temperature in Standard units (Kelvin). Convert to Fahrenheit **OR** peruse the API docs for a way to request the weather in Imperial units (Fahrenheit)!

Congrats! You've completed five pocket projects that look great on any resume! Pat yourself on the back and take some time to style everything fabulously before heading to the bonus.
