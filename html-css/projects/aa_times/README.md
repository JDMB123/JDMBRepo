# App Academy Times

Often when working as a front-end developer you'll be collaborating with a
designer. Most likely they will provide you with a sequence of screenshots and
specifications for you to convert into neat, maintainable HTML and CSS. Like so:

## Learning Goals

+ Be able to reason about styling approaches from screenshots of a design
+ Be able to layout elements in a custom Grid system
+ Know how to create interactive elements such as sidebars and dropdowns
+ Understand media queries and responsive design
+ Know how to use an icon font system
+ Know how to organize stylesheets in a Rails Application

# Phase 0: Setup

- Navigate to the root directory and `bundle install`.
- Run `rails s` in one terminal tab.
- In another tab, run `bundle exec guard -P livereload`.
- Open `localhost:3000' to see the site you're working on.

The `guard -P livereload` implements an easy-to-setup workflow using "style injection." *Style injection is the ability to see styling changes immediately after authoring them without having to manually refresh your browser.* Here is a [blog post][guard-livereload] explaining the setup and how it works.

## Stylesheets File Structure

Begin by familiarizing yourself with the stylesheets file structure. The `base` directory holds styles that should apply to the app globally and be accessible to component styles. The `components` directory holds styles for specific components. This helps us maintain our sanity as more styles are added over the app's lifespan.

```
/app/assets/stylesheets
+-- base
|   +-- colors.scss
|   +-- fonts.scss
|   +-- grid.scss
|   +-- layout.scss
|   +-- reset.scss
+-- components
|   +-- _gear_dropdown.scss
|   +-- _main_content.scss
|   +-- _main_nav.scss
|   +-- _masthead.scss
|   +-- _search_modal.scss
|   +-- _sections_nav.scss
|   +-- _sections_sidebar.scss
+-- application.scss
```

Next take a look at the `application.scss` file:

```scss
// CSS Reset
@import "base/reset.scss";

// Core
@import "base/colors.scss";
@import "base/fonts.scss";
@import "base/layout.scss";

// Grid
@import "base/grid.scss";

// Components
@import "components/*";
```

This file uses SCSS `import`s to define general styles that will apply to your
entire application and enforce the importing of these stylesheets in a
particular order. The order is very important! You can think of `application.scss` as building all the imported files into one giant CSS file.

Check out the `colors.scss` and `fonts.scss` files. They define SCSS variables
for you to use throughout the project to style your app. Defining SCSS variables
for an app's fonts and colors make changing any of them at any point more
maintainable and consistent. Use these given SCSS variables when defining any
fonts or color values.

**N.B.**: We won't dive any deeper into SCSS for this project but it does provide
a couple more cool features! Read about them [here][sass-features] if you're interested.

## A Few Things Before You Start...

- The project is provided as a Rails application to give you practice working with the Rails Asset Pipeline and navigating file structure
- Sometimes the HTML will be given and you will need to style with CSS;
sometimes the styles will be given and you will need to define the HTML
structure; and sometimes you will be required to code both.
- The `docs` folder contains two directories: `screenshots` and `copy`. You'll use the images found in `screenshots` for your mockups as you are styling. `copy` contains the text you'll copy and paste for the app's content.
- **Pro Tip**: Keep each mockup open and use it for reference as you're styling a component.
- HTML is rendered using rails partials in the
`/app/views/static_pages/index.html.erb` file, allowing for the styling of
each component separately.
- The images you will use to style your app are located in the
`app/assets/images` folder.
- Javascript files are provided in the `app/assets/javascripts` folder.
- A script tag in the `application.html.erb` loads [Font Awesome's][font-awesome] icon classes. For our app's icons, we will being
using ones imported from Font Awesome's list of icons and applying them to
elements using classes.

# Phase 1: Reset

Always begin styling an app with a clean slate by "resetting" the user agent
stylesheet provided by the browser in your `stylesheets/base/reset.scss` file.

To speed things up, we provided some tag selectors to get you started.

- Be wise about which properties to inherit, and which to hard-code.
- After you've set the other properties, set the `box-sizing` property to
`inherit` to have all elements behave the same by default (they will all have
their property set to `content-box`).
- Remove the bullets from list items.
- Make all images `block` elements. Each image's widths should be equal to its
parent's width (`100%`) and its height should grow proportionally (`auto`).
Set `img` `width` and `height` properties accordingly.
- Set the `cursor` to be the pointer hand on `button`s to make it obvious for users to click.
- Lastly, define clearfix.

# Phase 2: The Layout

Study the mockup to get an idea of the app's overall design.

- [Layout Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/main_content.jpg)

In order to write "cascading" style sheets, it is important that we pick out
common design elements and essential layout features. We will use the
`layout.scss` file when styling aspects common to our entire application.

Notice that all of app's content is styled in a defined block away from
the edges of the screen. Each component is also contained within regions with
clean margins. This is essential for user experience because it makes content
easier to read.

In `stylesheets/base/layout.scss`, style the `body`:
- Apply a width of `80%`.
- Center using `margin: 0 auto;`.
- Set the base font to `font-family: $serif`.
- Set `12px` as the default `font-size`.

# Phase 3: The Header

With our layout styling started we can now begin focusing on each component,
like the header. We can break the header down further into smaller components:
`main_nav` (with a `masthead` component containing our logo) and `sections_nav`
(with a `gear_dropdown` component).

- [Main Nav Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/main_nav.jpg)
- [Masthead Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/masthead.jpg)
- [Sections Nav Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/sections_nav.jpg)
- [Gear Dropdown Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/gear_dropdown.jpg)

We will style each one of these components in its own stylesheet. **N.B.:**
Breaking down stylesheets into each component is key to writing maintainable and
modular stylesheets.

## Main Nav

[Main Nav Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/main_nav.jpg)

Compare the provided HTML structure in `/views/shared/_main_nav.html.erb` to the
mockup. Notice we are missing the HTML for the right-side navigation. Let's add
it right now!

In `/views/shared/_main_nav.html.erb`:
- Add a `<nav>` with the class `"right-nav"`. Make sure it's contained within
the `"main-nav"` element.
- Add a `ul` element to your new `nav`. Make the buttons and gear icon list
items of this unordered list.
- Add "Subscribe Now" and "Log In" buttons. (Note: use HTML button tags for these elements)
- Add the gear icon.
  - Use [this list of Font Awesome icon classes][font-awesome] to find the right
  gear image. You may want to search "cog" instead of "gear".
  - Use the "Sections" and "Search" buttons defined in the `left-nav` as guides.

A great use for the `layout.scss` stylesheet is to define styling shared by
multiple elements. For example, the styling for the "Subscribe Now" button
is identical to the styling for the "Log In" button. **N.B.**: Using the same
styling on buttons makes it easier for users to know where to click throughout
your app.

In `stylesheets/base/layout.scss`:
- Style the buttons to look like the buttons in the mockup.
- each css property has been provided as a comment

Now it is time to style in the `components/_main_nav.scss` stylesheet. We have provided the selectors for you. Here are some guidelines:

- Add `display: flex` to the `.main-nav` and use `justify-content` for
horizontal spacing.
- Add `padding` to the `.main-nav` for vertical spacing.
- Flex the unordered lists to keep their children horizontally aligned and use
the `align-items` property to vertically align them.
- Apply `font-family`, `font-size`, and `text-transform` properties to the list
elements themselves.
- Use the `$lightest-gray` hover for the list elements without buttons.
- Style the necessary `margin` spacing between the texts and the icons.
- Use `font-size` to make the gear icon bigger.

## Masthead

[Masthead Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/masthead.jpg)

Open up `views/shared/_masthead.html.erb`. Pull up the provided
`components/_masthead.scss` stylesheet next to it using split screen.

Copy and paste all of the text content from `docs/copy/masthead.txt` into the
html file. We will build the HTML structure around the content. Here are some
guidelines:

- Notice that the `.masthead` is a flex-parent which means it will be used as an
html container element and all of its immediate child elements will be
flex-children.
- Set the `align-items` property to center the flex-children horizontally.
- The Rails Asset Pipeline takes care of precompiling our assets, so the
correct file path for images in the `assets/images` folder is
`assets/example_image.jpg`.
    + Images that are important to a website's search engine optimization (SEO)
    should be image tags rather than background images, as image tags are
    parsed by search engines.
- Only list elements should be present within unordered lists, but list
elements may contain other elements such as anchor tags or buttons.

After some HTML structuring you will notice some problems with the styling.
Refer to the masthead mock up and edit the stylesheet to fix the following
things:

- Remove the last border-right from `.masthead-links`.
- Make the first link in the `.language-nav` bold.
- Add application styling for anchor tags using the `layout.scss` file.

## Sections Nav

[Sections Nav Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/sections_nav.jpg)

Follow the patterns and coding patterns described above to style the Sections
Nav component. Define its styles in `stylesheets/components/_sections_nav.scss`
and HTML in `views/shared/_sections_nav.html.erb` file. Copy and paste the text
content from `docs/copy/sections_nav.txt`. Once you have fully completed the
Sections Nav bar **call over a TA to code review your Header**!

## Gear Dropdown

[Gear Dropdown Mockup](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/projects/aa_times/solution/docs/screenshots/gear_dropdown.jpg)

Take a look at the `app/assets/javascripts/components/dropdown.js` file. Read
the comments to get an understanding how the script works.

- Add the necessary `id` attribute to the gear icon's `li` (defined in
`_main_nav.html.erb`)
- Add the corresponding `.hidden` selector in `layout.scss`.

Open the `_gear_dropdown.html.erb` file where we have defined the HTML structure
for the dropdown. Notice the classes used to divide the different unordered
lists and the span elements for the subtitles.

- Render the partial as a child of the list element with the gear icon using
`<%= render partial: 'shared/gear_dropdown' %>`
- Click the gear icon to test the toggling of the `hidden` class.

Style the dropdown in `_gear_dropdown.scss` according to the mockup:

- Style its position:
    + Position the icon's `li` relatively.
        + This will allow the absolutely positioned dropdown to use this
        element as a reference point.
    + Position the dropdown absolutely and use `top` and `right` to adjust.
- Give the dropdown some background, padding, and a border.
- Use a defined px `width` for this dropdown.
    + Using px widths for HTML elements can be dangerous, as a page's styling
    can be ruined if either the window size or the content inside that element
    changes size drastically. For smaller elements with minimal content inside
    them, like this dropdown, there is less of a danger of that happening.
- Set the `z-index`. Remember the `z-index` property is used on positioned
elements to place them in front of or behind other elements with the largest
`z-index` being in front.
- Style the remaining fonts and margins being sure to use proper selectors.

For a final touch apply some `box-shadow` styling to the dropdown to give it a
bit more dimension. Box shadows are highly customizable with values for the
`x-offset`, `y-offset`, `blur-radius`, `spread-radius` and `color`. Here is an
example using `rgba` colors. Set the `rgba` values like so: `rgba(Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)`. The `Alpha` value controls the transparency. Let's make this shadow very transparent.

```css
box-shadow: -1px 4px 6px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.09);
```
