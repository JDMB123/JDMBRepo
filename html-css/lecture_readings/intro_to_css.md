### Overview 
- HTML is concerned with structuring content
- CSS is responsible for how to present content
- Push all visual presentation into CSS
- Avoid inline style declarations on HTML elements


#### Rectangles
- All elements are represented as rectangular boxes on a page
- Everything is a rectangle!
- The area a rectangle takes up is determined by:
  - **width/height** of content
  - **padding**
  - **border**
  - **margin**
