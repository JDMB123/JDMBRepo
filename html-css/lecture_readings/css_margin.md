#### Margin Reading

- Margin is like private space, it collapses
- Margin is see-through, not part of element
- Cannot be given background, not part of element
- Margin can be set to auto to distribute left and right margin space
- Margin can be negative, pulling the element and any that follow in the negative direction
- Weird gotcha: margins push through top and bottom of any direct ancestor elements that do not have a border or padding, or their overflow set to visible

#### When padding, when margin?

- Padding is part of an element, margin is not
- Margin collapses, padding always takes up space
- As part of the element, padding can have a background, margin is always see-through
